<!-- <p> We discover the existence of trigger patches -- distinct patches in the noise space that trigger the generation of objects in the diffusion model. By moving the trigger patch to a different position, the corresponding object will likely move to that location. Furthermore, this trigger effect also exists across various prompts—the same trigger patch can initiate the generation of different objects, depending on the given prompt. As illustrated in the following figure, when replacing the target patch within another initial noise with the trigger patch, the injection position would generate an object.The first row shows images generated from one seed. And we can identify the ``trigger patch'' located in the red box that tend to induce the generation of the object. If we inject the trigger patch into another noise, there will be objects in the position of the injection place in the images generated by the mixed noise.</p> -->

            Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation tasks; however, the role of initial noise has been rarely explored. In this study, we identify specific regions within the initial noise image, termed trigger patches, that play a key role for object generation in the resulting images. Notably, these patches are ``universal'' and can be generalized across various positions, seeds, and prompts. To be specific, extracting these patches from one noise and injecting them into another noise leads to object generation in targeted areas. We identify these patches by analyzing the dispersion of object bounding boxes across generated images, leading to the development of a posterior analysis technique.  Furthermore, we create a dataset consisting of Gaussian noises labeled with bounding boxes corresponding to the objects appearing in the generated images and train a detector that identifies these patches from the initial noise. To explain the formation of these patches, we reveal that they are outliers in Gaussian noise, and follow distinct distributions through two-sample tests. Finally, we find the misalignment between prompts and the trigger patch patterns can result in unsuccessful image generations. The study proposes a reject-sampling strategy to obtain optimal noise, aiming to improve prompt adherence and positional diversity in image generation.

</div>

<div style="width: 70%; margin:auto;margin-bottom: 5px;">
  <p>To anticipate the trigger patch before generation, we train a trigger patch detector, which functions similarly to an object detector but operates in the noise space. To achieve that, we first generate a large-scale dataset consisting of 20k initial noises paired with the bounding boxes of objects in the corresponding images. Then we design three variations of the dataset: The Augmented dataset uses bounding boxes of 5 classes; The Restricted only uses those of the class ``sports ball''. In the Class-Specific dataset, the model is required to output the class labels of the trigger patch. Finally, we train detectors on the datasets and the final results are as follows:</p>

  <!-- <p>We hypothesis that these trigger patches are typical outliers in the sampled noise, and have minimal correlation with prompts. We perform an energy-based two-sample test, which measures the distance between the distributions of two samples by computing the sum of pairwise Euclidean distances among all sample points. Meanwhile, it provides a p-value, which statistically quantifies the extent to which the distributions differ from each other. A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) suggests that the two sets of samples are not subjected to the same distribution. To test our hypothesis that the trigger patches are outliers in the initial noises, we divide 20,000 noises into ten groups according to the order of Trigger Entropy. Each group has 2,000 noises, and the first group has the lowest Trigger Entropy. Then we refer to the annotations, compute the center point of each bounding box, and extract the trigger patches with a fixed size 24$\times$24 around the center. Following these steps, we obtain a list of trigger patches for each group. We then create ten negative groups by randomly selecting a patch of 24$\times$24 in the same noise. Additionally, we craft a control group by randomly selecting patches of the same size. The results show that all the $p$-values between trigger patch groups and negative prompts are 0.0, while the $p$-value between the negative prompts and the control group is 0.938. Hence, the trigger patches and those random patches in the negative groups are from different distributions. Furthermore, we examine the relationship between the energy distance of trigger patches from negative patches and the trigger entropy, as illustrated in the figure. This figure reveals a clear negative correlation: the greater the deviation of a patch from the original distribution, the more likely it is to be a trigger patch characterized by low trigger entropy. This observation again supports our hypothesis that these trigger patches are outliers within the noise.</p> -->

  <!-- <p>Position bias has significant implications, particularly in synthetic data generation using diffusion models. For instance, when generating an automobile dataset, a model exhibiting position bias might consistently place roadblocks in the left-bottom corner of the image, leading to skewed data. Moreover, such a bias can affect the diversity of generated images in applications like ChatGPT, where similar images are produced for varied prompts due to the presence of trigger patches with low trigger entropy in the initial noise. <br></p>
  <p>To mitigate this, we have developed a method involving the use of the detector for reject sampling. This process begins with the detection of trigger patches in the initial noise. If the confidence scores of the bounding boxes exceed a predefined threshold, the region within the box is flagged for regeneration. Our approach is designed to ensure that the noise used for generation is ``pure'' and has no strong trigger patches that could confine object placement.<br></p>
  <p>We calculate the average entropy for the bounding boxes in these groups to assess the impact of our method on diversity and positional bias. The entropy is similar to the trigger entropy, with higher values indicating greater diversity. Our experimental setup includes generating images from 10 random prompts described by ChatGPT, followed by image generation using diffusion models. The results are as follows:</p> -->
